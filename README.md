# Week-3-Bootstrap-Portfolio# 

### Description
In this project, I have created a Bootstrap Portfolio. I recently have been learning more about Responsive design and Bootstrap through the course, as well as through doing multiple different tutorials. I was inspired to do this assignment from my curiosity to learn more about how to build mobile-first, responsive websites. Here, you can find the links to the variety of some of the things I have learned.
