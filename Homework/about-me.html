                <p>Thanks for checking out my page! My name is Michelle Bennett, I’m in the last year of my 20s, and I have been living in Birmingham for just over a year. My favourite colour is green and some of my hobbies include reading, writing, houseplants, and watching YouTube. I am currently studying Coding through the University of Birmingham. 
                </p>    
                <p>I wanted to study coding because I have done some work in the past within the print production industry and, of all the work and study that I have done so far, working within some kind of creative field has always been my personal best. It seemed like the next logical step for me, in order to maximise my skill sets, was to learn to apply my creativity through web development.
                </p>
                <p>I have a ton of working experience in a number of different fields relating to customer service and customer satisfaction, hospitality, sales/canvassing and brand representation. Within these positions I’ve learned a valuable number of skill sets such as time management, attention to detail, and the ability to excel in sometimes stressful circumstances, of which I will continue to use to help push myself through this program.
                </p>     
                <p>At this moment in time I have learned the foundations of HTML, CSS and a touch of Javascript. Currently, I am working on building responsive, mobile-first web pages using Bootstrap. By the end of this course, I hope to be highly skilled in Full Stack Web Development. With enough confidence, and my new found skill sets, I hope to continue working within the coding world to empower others in being a presence on the internet. 
                </p>
                <p>The End!
                </p>
